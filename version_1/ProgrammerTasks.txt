Task 4: Develop code to calculate CountryDefaultDayPremium

Common task description:
Medical risk premium calculation formula:
Premium = CountryDefaultDayPremium * DayCount * AgeCoefficient * InsuranceLimitCoefficient
Develop code to and related database structures to provide
CountryDefaultDayPremium calculation from formula above.

Task details:
Create database table country_default_day_rate with two
columns (COUNTRY_IC and DEFAULT_DAY_RATE). Table content example:
COUNTRY_IC  	DEFAULT_DAY_RATE
LATVIA      	1.00
SPAIN	        2.50
JAPAN	        3.50

Develop backend code to get DEFAULT_DAY_RATE coefficient by
country ic code.

To mountain supported country list, please create classifiers
table in database with following columns (TITLE, DESCRIPTION).
This table will contain all classifiers (predefined values).
TITLE  	    DESCRIPTION
COUNTRY	    Country classifier  - this is country classifier.

Available(supported) COUNTRY classifier values will be stored
inside classifier_values database table. For COUNTRY classifier
they are following:
IC  	DESCRIPTION
LATVIA	Country Latvia
SPAIN	Country Spain
JAPAN	Country Japan

By default, application support only this three country:
LATVIA, SPAIN, JAPAN.

Common task description:
Medical risk premium calculation formula:
Premium = CountryDefaultDayPremium * DayCount * AgeCoefficient * InsuranceLimitCoefficient
Develop code to provide DayCount calculation from formula above.

Task details:
DayCount = Agreement Date To - Agreement Date From

Task 6: Develop code to calculate AgeCoefficient

Common task description:
Medical risk premium calculation formula:
Premium = CountryDefaultDayPremium * DayCount * AgeCoefficient * InsuranceLimitCoefficient

AgeCoefficient calculation from formula above.

Task details:
Insured person age must be calculated as
(in full years: 1, 4, 18, 50, etc.):
current date - person birthdate.

To store AgeCoefficient values database table age_coefficient
must be developed. Age_coefficient table must have the following
structure:
AGE_FROM  	AGE_TO  	COEFFICIENT
0	        5	        1.10
6	        10      	0.70
11	        17      	1.00
18	        40      	1.10
41	        65      	1.20
